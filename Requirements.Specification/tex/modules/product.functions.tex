\subsection{Product Functions}
The major features of the plugin are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{3D Line drawing:} 
Users can click and drag to create a line in their scene, which is made up of control points.

\item \textbf{Line editing:} 
Users can move control points to change the shape of their line.

\item \textbf{Line deleting:}
Users can erase a previously drawn line.

\item \textbf{Line saving:}
Lines are stored so that re-opening the Unity project file does not affect lines the user has drawn.

\item \textbf{Animation tweaking:}
Once the animation is generated, a panel allows users to edit the animation by changing certain constraints.

\end{itemize}
