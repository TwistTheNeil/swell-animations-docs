\subsection{Interface Requirements}
	The interface will be built into Unity and rely on several features of the Unity platform.  
	Coding in Unity can be done with three different languages (C\#, UnityScript, and Boo).  Files in Unity that contain executable code are referred to as Scripts.  All the coding on the Unity side will be done in C\#. \par

	The interface and display for the animations will be created within Unity.  This will take advantage of Unity's UI framework and rendering capabilities. 
\par
	Unity also allows external plug-ins to be used and referenced in Unity scripts.  This project will use this feature in order to reference our core library where calculations will actually be performed.  The core library will be coded in C/C++.  The core library will be portable and will have the potential to be used in other frameworks. \par
