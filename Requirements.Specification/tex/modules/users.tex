\subsection{Users}
This plugin is geared towards animators and the general users of the framework called Unity. Unity is a cross platform game engine which emphasises portability for games and offers compatibility on various devices. A major part of game development is creating general animations for custom character models which are not built into the engine. Unity based games need to implement character animation in some other way (e.g. key frame animation). This plugin will bring a feature to Unity users which will allow them to easily animate models of characters using fluid hand motion drawing. Any user who would like to use a pre-defined method of animation instead of making their own, which would be very time consuming, would be able to use our plugin which would enable them to do so effortlessly.

Users are assumed to have experience using Unity and installing plugins with little to no technical experience.
