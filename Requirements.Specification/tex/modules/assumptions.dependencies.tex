\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
Since this project is going to be used as a plugin for the Unity framework, the target platform would
need to have Unity installed. Unity is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.\\
Apart from the framework itself, in order to build the project, the target environment
would need to have C\# installed for the front-end and C++ (g++) installed for the backend.\\
We will be using open source libraries to assist with the curve fitting and the math aspects
of the control point generation. These are listed in the \hyperref[App:AppendixML]{Math and Libraries Appendix}
