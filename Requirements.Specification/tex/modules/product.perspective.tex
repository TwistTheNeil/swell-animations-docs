\subsection{Product Perspective}
This is an open source product. The source code is free to download. This software is aimed toward game developers and Unity users who need to quickly and easily animate characters for their projects.

The two major components of the systems are the Unity User Interface (UI) and the Core Functionality:

\begin{itemize}
\item The Unity UI is laid out over Unity's default interface. Every panel and tool available in Unity is still accessible. With the plugin installed, extra panels and tools (to be used for drawing, editing, deleting the line, and tweaking settings to modify the animation) will be observed and usable also.

\item The Core Functionality is the back end where all the math and computation is done. Once the line drawing information is passed to the back end, the core functionality fits the curve and generates the animation applied to the character model.

\end{itemize}
