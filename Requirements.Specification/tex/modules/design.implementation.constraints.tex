\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
This program is created in two parts, the frontend and a backend.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frontend: This is the part of the program which the user interacts with
                    and is programmed in C\#.
    \item Backend: This is the part of the program which the frontend interacts
                    with. It holds the algorithms required for processing user input
                    and is programmed in C++.
\end{itemize}
Minimum hardware requirements would inculde:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Graphics card with DX9 (shader model 2.0) capabilities
    \item 1GB RAM
    \item 500 MB of free HDD space
\end{itemize}
