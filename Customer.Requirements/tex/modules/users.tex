This plugin is geared towards animators and the general users of the framework called Unity. Unity is a cross platform game engine which emphasises portability for games and offers compatibility on various devices. However, one of the major parts of game development is a general animation of characters using models within the engine which is not built into the engine yet. Most games which use Unity needs to implement this in some way. This plugin will bring a feature to Unity users which will allow them to easily animate models of characters using functions specified within the plugin. Any user who would like to use a pre-defined method of animation instead of making their own, which would be very time consuming, would be able to use our plugin which would enable them to do so effortlessly.
