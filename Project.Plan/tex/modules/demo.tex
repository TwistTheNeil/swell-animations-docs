\section{Demo}
Our main use case for this project is simple. Given a 3D snake model, the user can draw a path in Unity in which the snake will be physically animated along. Before importing the model to Unity, the character must be rigged, meaning that its "skeleton" is a complete heirarchy of interconnected bones. Because the model is a snake, the skeleton will also be simple. It will consist of 4-5 joints connected by bones.

By the end of Winter Term 2016, our team will have developed the plugin to the point where this functionality is possible. The user will be able to do the following, which our team will show in a comprehensive demo. 

We will show that it is possible to install the plugin and use it within Unity. We will demonstrate the ability to select the snake model for animation generation. We will show the ability to draw, edit, and delete the path via the UI within Unity. After the animation is generated, the user will be able to watch the animation back and save it. This completes the front-end demo.

Once the line is drawn, the program will generate an animation for the snake in 3 dimensional space, demonstrating the back-end functionality. This includes curve fitting to the path, path following of the model, and physically realistic animation of the model.

Next term (Spring 2016), the focus will be to refine this animation algorithm if needed to work on more complex models and add animation layering.
