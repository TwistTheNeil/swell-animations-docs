3D animation can be a painstakingly tedious activity. To create a desired animation, animators go through the long process of key framing. Key frames are set positions that define the start and end points of a movement, sequences of poses in time. Typically, animators assign poses to certain frames over time, so that in-between motions can be generated by a computer. To get an accurate animation, artists usually must assign many key frames, then spend time adjusting and editing them to be more precise. The fact that industry professionals take so much time and effort to do this shows that for an amateur or untrained artist, creating good 3D animation is close to impossible.

Researchers in the IMAGINE group at INRIA (in Grenoble, France) have noticed this problem. They have made significant progress on a project called ERC Expressive, where they aim to offer more intuitive tools to author 3D digital content. The IMAGINE team has invented a technique for animation called space-time sketching, in which a user can draw a line in the path they want a model to take and it will be animated accordingly. As the character follows the path, its model bends and changes shape in a physically realistic way. Their system currently supports creating different movements with the path such as bouncing, rolling, and twisting.

Based on the previous research by INRIA and their paper \href{https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01153763/file/SpaceTimeSketching.pdf}{Space-time sketching of character animation}, we want to build a Unity plugin that allows users to animate ``characters" along a sketched path under a set of constraints.
