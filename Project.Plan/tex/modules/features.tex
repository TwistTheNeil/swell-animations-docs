\subsection{Features}
(See more in the Customer Requirements Document)
\begin{itemize}
 \item The user will be able to draw a line in 3D space from a selected object to its destination.
 \item The hand-drawn line will be used to calculate the motion and direction of the character, and then it will be animated.
 \item The animation generated should satisfy two constraints:
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Be as close to the user-drawn line as possible
	  \item Be the most realistic animation possible based on the path
	\end{itemize}
 \item The user will be able to refine the path using control points and if time allows, editing of path can be done using the over-sketching technique.
 \item The user will be able to delete the paths they've drawn.
 \item The user will be able to see the paths they've drawn by selecting multiple characters at a time.
 \item If multiple characters have the same skeleton/rig (are copies of the same model), the user can copy and paste animations, by means of copying the paths, to other characters.
\item The user will be able to save and export paths to a file to be re-loaded into the plugin at a later time.
 \item This functionality will be presented in the form of a plugin to Unity.
\end{itemize}
