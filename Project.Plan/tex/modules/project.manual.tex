\section{Product Manual}
A manual will need to be produced to assist users and explain the functionality of the product. This manual will contain everything that the user needs to know about how to successfully use our tool --- this might consist of what the UI will look like, how to use the UI, and output that the user can expect. 

This manual will also include a setup/installation manual to explain how the user can get started using our tool.
