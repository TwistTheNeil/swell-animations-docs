\subsection{Infrastructure setup}
This includes setting up the repository, automated build setup, and issue tracking software. Our repository of choice will be Github. We will also use Github to keep track of issues that arise during the development of our system. We shall also be using LaTeX to typeset the planning, requirement, and design documents as a standard which will be checked into Github and so we will be able to collaborate on it together and maintain revision history.
