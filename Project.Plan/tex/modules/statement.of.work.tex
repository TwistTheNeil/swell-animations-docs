\subsection{Unity UI prototypes}
Both prototypes will focus on drawing the path.

\subsubsection{Prototype \#1} 
\label{sec:ptype1}
The first prototype will be produced in order to help define requirements and provide the foundation for the full plugin. The features of the UI prototype will include the buttons, toolbar, panels, and tools needed to carry out what features we've described. This will help us identify potential requirements issues early on instead of later down the road. Based on the user's drawing motions, we will generate control points to form a path. We will create a simple toolbar which will feature a pen and mouse tool for drawing and refining the path, respectively. 

\subsubsection{Prototype \#2} 
\label{sec:ptype2}
Given an arbitrary set of control points, calculate and draw the B-spline in the viewport. The motivation for this prototype is to implement B-spline calculations for control points generated by user drawing on screen.

A few sets of control points will be predetermined and supplied as input for this prototype, so that this prototype is not completion dependent of the first prototype. However in practice the input of the B-spline calculator will be control points generated by the lines drawn by the user in the viewport.

The refining and deleting of the path are the next steps past the prototype and make up the UI functionality. This will be done with a separate refine path pen tool.
